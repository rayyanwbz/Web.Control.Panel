# Web.Control.Panel
This project introduces an intuitive web interface for controlling robot movement. Users can easily command the robot to move forward, backward, left, or right, as well as bring it to a stop. For convenient tracking and analysis, all commands are automatically logged with timestamps in a secure database.
